RASE - Run At Sun Event

This is an Emacs extension that allows user provided set of functions
to be run at some sun events, right now - sunrise and sunset.

It's inspired by some settings found in Juri Linkov's .emacs.

The solar built-in package is used, so calendar-latitude and
calendar-longitude variables need to be set to appropriate location.

Usage example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; currently in Sofia, Bulgaria
(custom-set-variables
 '(calendar-latitude 42.68)
 '(calendar-longitude 23.31))

(require 'rase)

;; load without enabling some GNU/Emacs 24 built-in themes
(load-theme 'whiteboard t t)
(load-theme 'wombat t t)

;; create an one-argument function to be invoked at sun events
(defun switch-themes (sun-event)
  "Switch themes on sunrise and sunset."
  (cond ((eq sun-event 'sunrise)
	 (ignore-errors
	   (disable-theme 'wombat))
	 (enable-theme 'whiteboard))
	((eq sun-event 'sunset)
	 (ignore-errors
	   (disable-theme 'whiteboard))
	 (enable-theme 'wombat))))

;; sign this function to be invoked on sun events
(add-to-list 'rase-hook 'switch-themes)

;; start the run-at-sun-event daemon
(rase-start t)
#+END_SRC
